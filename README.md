# CMSC434DoodleApp
This is my doodler assignment for CMSC434

My doodlers primary interface contains a tool bar at the top, a main white drawing screen, and a tool bar at the bottom. The tool bar at the top contains an undo button, brush size button, reset button, opactiy button, and redo button, in that order. The bottom tool bar shows a selection of colors that the user cna draw with. Initially, the user starts off with the color in the upper right hand corner that is shown as slected, but the user can then pick any color. The user cna draw on their phone with their finger, choose from three differnt brush sizes, and change the opativity of the color on a scale from 0 to 100 percent. The user cna also use the reset button to completely clear their drawing, or they can use the undo and redo buttons to fix mistakes.
